Modify Makefile
-Added new file to git: tester.sh
-Wrote a shell script that runs randall and checks the length of output
-Script works as intended but outputs additional command not found errors, will go back and fix this later
COMMIT

Split randall Implementation
-Created all new files and added them to the git
-Options.h and options.c do not contain much at first, will later process command line input
-Added writebytes function to output files
-Added all functions under "Hardware Implementation" to rand64_hw.h and .c
-Removed static keywords and fixed small bugs
COMMIT

Add Options
-Added a switch statement to randall.c that parses the options, storing input and output options into variables to use later an delivering error messages for invalid options
-Added if statements and boolean flags to check different input and output options
COMMIT

Add /F Input Option
-Created new function in rand64-sw that changed the source file for random input
-Called this function if boolean flag for useFile mentioned above is true

Add mrand48-r Option
-Added new mrand48-r.h and .c files to handle new implementation
-Created init and fini functions in .h
COMMIT
-Researched srand and mrand functions, seeded random value with current time in buffer
-Combined resulting long ints into one long long
-Changed randall.c to use these functions instead of other hardware implementations
COMMIT

Add -o N Option
-In randall.c, if stdio flag false, allocated bytes in buffer using malloc
-Input random bytes into buffer
-Used a while loop to output these random bytes in certain intervals

I did indeed forget about the existence of options.h and options.c and accidentally implemented the options in randall.c. Though I may not have enough time to fix this I am aware of it
