General:
-lab4.drib is missing because the session was interrupted and incomplete (started over in lab5.drib)
-1.1-1.4 complete, slightly different files because exer2.diff was not as it should be

Lab 1.5:
1. mv and sh are both in /usr/bin
command: which mv, which sh
2. ar creates, modifies, and extracts from archives
pr converts text files for printing
command: ls /usr/bin to find commnds, man ar, man pr, to find what they do
3. executes emacs, will open up the editor
command: which /usr/local/cs/bin/emacs to find executable, ran command to find what it does
4. /usr/bin/gcc is 8.4.1, gcc is 11.2.0. They are different because gcc points to /usr/locl/cs/bin, which is likely updated more often because it is use more often on the server
command: /usr/bin/gcc -v, gcc -v, which gcc
5. chmod u+sx changes permission to allow the owner of a file to set user or group ID on execution and to execute a file, chmod o-w removes permissions of other users not in the file's group to write on the file.
command: man chmod (other details listed in manual)
6. the directories that have been modifie are as follows:

command: find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 (4 weeks in days)
7. 318. I did not include them here for readability.
command: which find (locate directory of find, which was /usr/bin), find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l (find symbolic links in this directory)
8. The oldest file is libcrypt.so.1.1.0
command: cd /usr/lib64 to change directory, ls -lt to determine oldest file
9. 6 commands
command: emacs to enter emacs, C-h a transpose to search for commands with transpose
10. Yank reinserts the most recent killed text and can be invoked with C-y.
command: emacs to enter emacs, C-h f yank to learn about the command
11. The directory listing of emacs shows the root directories (. and ..) while ls -l does not. They also have different coloration.
command: cd /usr/bin to set directory, ls -l to output files, emacs to enter emacs, M-x dired to output files in emacs
12. 3 processes, running for 00:07:58,1-02:18:07, 00:44:18, 0.0%, 3.1%, 0.0% CPU cycles respectively
command: ps -C xagt to list processes named xagt, find PIDs, and times running. ps aux -C xagt to find %CPU cycles being taken up
