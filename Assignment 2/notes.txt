Exercise 2.1
1. Expression to compute 3^(4^5): (expt 3 (expt 4 5))
2. Expression to compute number of bits to represent 3^(4^5): (* (expt 4 5) (log 3 2)), answer is 1624 (rounded up)
3. C-h k C-h k opens up a description in the help buffer of the C-h k binding itself. This is because the original command triggers describe-key, which will give a descrption of the command you type next. It is "an interactive compiled Lisp function in 'help.el'"
4. C-h k M-SPC opens up a description in the help buffer of the M-SPC command, for the same reasons as shown above (C-h k desribes the function of whatever keystroke is typed afterward). The M-SPC command deletes all whitespace (spaces and tabs) around the point it is invoked, leaving one space left
5. The general way to do M-SPC is the function just-one-space, which takes an argument N and leaves that many spaces left around the point at which it is invoked. If N is negative, it will delete that many newlines in addition to surrounding spaces and tabs.

Homework
1. When invoked on an empty file, randline will return an IndexError, "list index is out of range."
2. This particular file is not compatible with python3; running it as such will return a syntax error within the file. This is because python3 is backward incompatible with python2.
